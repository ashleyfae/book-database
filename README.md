# Book Database

WIP

I have a book plugin already, but Book Database is a fun recoding project for me. It's basically, "what would my other plugin look like if I could start over with zero backwards compatibility?" -- Basically a rewrite considering all the things I now hate about my other plugin and what I wish I could have done differently.

Things I'm focusing on:

* Fewer third party libraries. These started to really piss me off in my other plugin.
* Better job scaling, when people want to add *thousands* of books.
* Better UI and UX.
* And finally, I'm focusing more on what I want from this plugin, rather than what other people say they want.

I'm not sure if I'll ever officially release this. I'm mostly building this for myself and for funsies. Then we'll see what happens.

## Todo:

* Statistics.
* Purchase links? Ew.
* Update book info fields in book submission to only show enabled ones.
* Possibly add something for tropes.

For my site:

* Erotica warning.
